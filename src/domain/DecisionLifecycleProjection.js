/**
 * ============================================================================
 * AI Decision Journal
 * Decision Lifecycle Projection
 *
 * File: DecisionLifecycleProjection.js
 *
 * Purpose:
 * Projects canonical Decision lifecycle events into the read models used by
 * Decision History and Decision Timeline.
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 * - Project lifecycle events into Decision History entries
 * - Project lifecycle events into Decision Timeline entries
 * - Preserve event identity and provenance across projections
 * - Remain independent of persistence and presentation
 *
 * Notes:
 * A lifecycle event is the organizational fact.
 *
 * History and Timeline are different representations of that fact.
 *
 * This module does not:
 * - detect Decision differences
 * - create lifecycle events
 * - validate lifecycle transitions
 * - persist projections
